# Contributing Guidelines

## Merging Pull Requests

1. Don't merge your own PRs.
2. Changes that touch core code (`lib/`) or its unit tests (`tests/units/`) require at least two positive reviews.
3. New code (e.g. new modules) also requires at least two positive reviews.
4. Other changes, especially small ones, can be merged with just a single positive review.
5. If you've done the review and are allowed to merge according to the rules, but for whatever reason don't feel comfortable doing so, it's perfectly fine to ask for another opinion. (Though make sure to explicitly ask someone else. Don't just comment "looks good to me" and close the browser tab.)
